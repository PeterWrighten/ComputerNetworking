# Prerequisites

Based on the fact of my poor coding (Both C++ and Python), maybe It is necessary for me to make more prerequites for me. And I would memo them here.

# Notes

# Python

* Code

ASCII(1byte) --> Unicode(2 byte) --> UTF-8(ENG:1 byte, CHN:3 byte)

UTF-8 always uses for storing and trandmitting data.

Unicode always uses for display data.

python: type "str";

```
ord():char -> code
chr():code -> char

\uxxxx: hexadecimal -> char
```
